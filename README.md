# Soft Robot Optimal Control via Reduced-Order Finite Element Models

This repository accompanies the following papers 
- "[Soft Robot Optimal Control via Reduced-Order Finite Element Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02092)" by Sander Tonkens, Joseph Lorenzetti, and Marco Pavone.
- "[Data-Driven Spectral Submanifold Reduction for Nonlinear Optimal Control of High-Dimensional Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05712)" by John Irvin Alora, Mattia Cenedese, Edward Schmerling, George Haller, and Marco Pavone

We provide an implementation of various optimal control algorithms (SCP, iLQR, LQR, etc.) for nonlinear reduced order
 models based on nonlinear Finite Element Models (FEMs). Specifically, it interfaces with the 
 [SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/download/) simulation engine to simulate Soft Robots modeled using FEMs.

## Install and setup environment

Tested platforms: Ubuntu: 20.04, Python 3.8 (tested with 3.8.2, 3.8.3, 3.8.12)

---

##### Set up virtual environment

Note that instructions assume a virtual environment and python packages installed in site-packages of environment

miniconda2 and anaconda3 (probably others, but these have been tested) can be used. 

SofaPython3 requires Python 3.8+. If using a package manager / virtual environment, ensure that `qmake --version` points to the same Qt version as Sofa (in order to enable running Sofa from the terminal (without `runSofa`))

Create and activate `sofa` conda environment
```
conda create --name sofa python=3.8
conda activate sofa
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
conda activate sofa
```

Note that you can activate and deactivate this environment with ``conda activate`` and ``conda deactivate``.

---
##### Install python packages
```
conda install numpy, scipy
conda install pyqt
pip install slycot   # required for control package
pip install control
pip install pyDOE
pip install cvxpy
pip install osqp
pip install sip
```
Install pybind11 2.6.0 - DO NOT install 2.8.0 as it will throw compilation errors when compiling SofaPython3
```
conda install -c conda-forge pybind11=2.6.0
```
There should now be a directory {PYTHON_ENV}/share/cmake/pybind11 (e.g. ${HOME}/anaconda3/envs/sofa/share/cmake/pybind11.
 
This stores the cmake files for pybind11, necessary to compile SofaPython3. 

Track pybind2.8 issue here: [pybindissue](https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3/pull/216)

Set your environment variables in `$HOME/.bashrc`. Should look like below
```
export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/sofa-plugins/STLIB/python3/src"
export SP3_BLD=$HOME/sofa/build/install/plugins/SofaPython3
export SOFA_BLD=$HOME/sofa/build
export GUROBI_HOME="/opt/gurobi950/linux64"
export PATH="${PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/bin"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/lib"
export GRB_LICENSE_FILE=/opt/gurobi950/gurobi.lic
```
Execute `source ~/.bashrc` in terminal to make the appropriate changes.

---
##### Get Plugin Libraries

Download the libraries SoftRobots, STLIB, and SofaPython3
```
mkdir $HOME/sofa-plugins
git clone https://github.com/SofaDefrost/SoftRobots $HOME/sofa-plugins/SoftRobots
git clone https://github.com/SofaDefrost/STLIB.git $HOME/sofa-plugins/STLIB
git clone https://github.com/sofa-framework/SofaPython3.git $HOME/sofa-plugins/SofaPython3
```

Now create a CMakeLists.txt file in the `$HOME/sofa-plugins/` directory and add the following:
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.11)

find_package(SofaFramework)

sofa_add_subdirectory(plugin STLIB/ STLIB)
sofa_add_subdirectory(plugin SoftRobots/ SoftRobots)
sofa_add_subdirectory(plugin SofaPython3/ SofaPython3)
```

---


##### Install Sofa

Follow [instructions](https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/getting-started/build/linux/) to download dependencies (compiler, CMake, Qt, etc.)

Set up directory structure for Sofa and clone repository:
```
mkdir $HOME/sofa/src
mkdir $HOME/sofa/build
git clone https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa.git $HOME/sofa/src
```

---

##### Build Sofa

Run `cmake-gui` to run the CMake GUI. 

Set the source path to `$HOME/sofa/src` and the build path to `$HOME/sofa/build`. Make sure the path to installation of Qt is correct by adding an entry `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` and setting it to the appropriate location (e.g. `/home/jlorenze/Qt/5.15.0/gcc_64`).

Run **Configure**, and set the compiler according to the instructions [here](https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/getting-started/build/linux/).

Then, add entry `SOFA_BUILD_METIS` and enable it. 

Find the entry `SOFA_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES` and set it to `$HOME/sofa-plugins` where `$HOME` is replaced with the actual path (e.g. `/home/jlorenze/`). 

Also, add and enable entry `SOFTROBOTS_IGNORE_ERRORS` which will allow SoftRobots to compile without the STLIB library. 

Next, set filepath entry `pybind11_DIR` to `$HOME/anaconda3/envs/sofa/share/cmake/pybind11`.

Ensure the following bool entries are activated (`PLUGIN_SOFTROBOTS`, `PLUGIN_SOFAPYTHON3`, `STLIB`)


Run **Configure** again (should complete with no errors), and then run **Generate**.

To build (use `-j` flag to use all cores):
```
cd $HOME/sofa/build
make -j
make install
```

Test that Sofa launches by running `$SOFA_BLD/bin/runSofa -l $SP3_BLD/lib/libSofaPython3.so`.

---

##### Install Gurobi
Instructions are for v9.5.0

Install Gurobi [Instructions](https://cdn.gurobi.com/wp-content/plugins/hd_documentations/documentation/9.0/quickstart_linux.pdf)

Download Gurobi and setup an **academic** account [here](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer-eula/)

Run the following to install Gurobi in the system `/opt` folder
```
sudo tar xvfz ~/Downloads/gurobi9.5.0_linux64.tar.gz -C /opt/
cd /opt/
sudo chmod +777 /opt/gurobi950
sudo chmod +777 /opt/gurobi950/linux64
```
Once gurobi is installed and you have you created an academic account, you need to obtain and install the license. You can obtain it [here](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/)

You then need to put the license in `/opt/gurobi950` during `grbgetkey`.

Next, install Gurobi modules for Python (see full instructions [here](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044290292-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-for-Python-))
```
cd $GUROBI_HOME
python setup.py install
```

##### Installation of ROS2

SofaPython3 requires Python 3.8, hence the instructions for ROS2 compatible with python3.8 (which is default for ubuntu 20.04) is provided. 

Download the Debian binaries for [ROS2 Foxy Fitzroy](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Foxy/) on ubuntu. 
Follow the steps provided in the link to complete the setup of ROS2. Follow steps below for further installation instructions.

ROS2 recommends the usage of colcon for building packages:

```
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
pip install -U git+https://github.com/colcon/colcon-common-extensions.git
```

Lark parser is required for ROS2 

```
pip install lark_parser
```

Next setup the ROS2 workspace, follow the instructions of step 1+2 of the [guided tutorial](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace/). Optionally you can use `../setup.zsh` instead of `../setup.bash` and you can add it to your shell so that it is sourced upon launching the terminal.

Next we will setup a package (using cmake) to have the service required for using SOFA with cvxpy, for Sequential Convex Programming trajectory optimization problems. Setup is based upon the [Custom ROS2 Interface Page](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Custom-ROS2-Interfaces/):

```
# Navigate to src directory in root of workspace.
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake soft_robot_control_ros
cd soft_robot_control_ros
mkdir srv
cp {$REPO_DIR}/dependencies/ros/GuSTOsrv.srv srv/
```

Add the following to `CMakeLists.txt` in `${WS_DIR}/src/soft_robot_control_ros`:

```
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)

rosidl_generate_interfaces(soft_robot_control_ros
  "srv/GuSTOsrv.srv"
 )
```

Add the following to `package.xml`

```
<build_depend>rosidl_default_generators</build_depend>

<exec_depend>rosidl_default_runtime</exec_depend>

<member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>
```

Build the `soft_robot_control_ros` package. From `${WS_DIR}` run

```
colcon build --packages-select soft_robot_control_ros
```

Within your workspace `${WS_DIR}`, to source it run:

```
. install/setup.bash  # Alternative: . install/setup.zsh
```

To validate that the service is created run the `ros2 interface show` command:

```
ros2 interface show soft_robot_control_ros/srv/GuSTOsrv
```

---
## Setup Environment variables (optional)

Add the following to your `.bashrc` file to auto source ROS 2 workspaces
```
source $HOME/ros2_foxy/install/setup.bash
source $HOME/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
conda activate sofa
```

---
## Running soft-robot-control and Sofa

There are two methods to launching simulations using soft-robot-control with Sofa. Both require setting the problem file
in `problem_specification.py`.

1. Run with the simulation GUI. `$SOFA_BLD/bin/runSofa -l $SP3_BLD/lib/libSofaPython3.so ~/soft-robot-control/launch_sofa.py` then `python3 ~/soft-robot-control/examples/diamond/diamond_rompc.py run_rompc_solver` to run controller.
Ensure that the `diamond_rompc` problem in `problem_specification.py` is uncommented.

2. Run in the background. `python launch_sofa.py` (Requires modifying `sofa_lib_path` to match environment in `launch_sofa.py` file)
